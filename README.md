## Description

The **Car Information Scraper** is a Next.js application designed to scrape detailed features and specifications of cars from Edmunds.com based on user input (year, make, and model). The application uses Puppeteer for web scraping and provides a responsive, user-friendly interface built with Tailwind CSS. Additionally, it supports dark mode for enhanced usability.

This project demonstrates how to integrate modern web technologies with server-side scraping to deliver dynamic and interactive experiences.
